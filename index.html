        <h1> About </h1>


        <p> Coding Is When You Use Many Different Languages Of Code Such As HTML, CSS, JavaScript. There Are Many Others In Addition To These Ones Coding Allows You To Make Apps, Websites, And Many Other Things What You Are Currently Looking At Right Now Is A Website Coded With HTML And CSS. I Like Coding Because You Can Do Many Things And Be Creative And Help Solve World Problems And Also Be Written In Multiple Languages So You Can Master Coding With HTML Then Move On To CSS Or JavaScript Or Many Other Languages And Coding Can Also Be Cool You Can Make a Really Cool Function In Coding That Changes The Color Of Someones Screen Or Even a Button That Changes Colors. </p>
